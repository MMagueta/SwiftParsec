#+TITLE: Swift Parsec

* What is this?

A light monadic parser combinator library in Swift.

* What is a monadic parser combinator?

An atomic parser that is specialized into handling specific
categories of input on a language, able to assert errors and
return matching types to tokens. With such atomic parsers one
can create a language parser fitting to a grammar.

* Should you use it?

That is up to you. This is my first Swift code, so I wouldn't
take this as the cornerstone of a work, unless you know what 
you are doing. I do have a few principles though:

- Minimal code
- Beauty over performance (in situations they are mutex)
